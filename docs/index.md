# Argo

Argo is a library aimed at the fast calculation of generalised time matrices from GTFS files. 
By applying appropriate simplifications on the GTFS dataset, the library is able to calculate such matrices at scale. 
For example, it was possible to calculate an MSOA-to-MSOA matrix for England and Wales in ~1 hour (with a relatevile large machine).
